# Plotly.rs

Plotly.rs is a plotting library powered by [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/). The aim is to bring over to Rust all the functionality that `Python` users have come to rely on with the added benefit of type safety and speed.

Plotly.rs is free and open source. You can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs). Issues and feature requests can be posted on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs/issues).

## API Docs

This book is intended to be a recipe index, which closely follows the [plotly.js examples](https://plotly.com/javascript/), and is complemented by the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/plotly).

## Contributing
