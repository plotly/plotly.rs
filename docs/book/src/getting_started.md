# Getting Started

To start using [plotly.rs](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs) in your project add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
plotly = "0.8.4"
```

[Plotly.rs](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs) is ultimately a thin wrapper around the `plotly.js` library. The main job of this library is to provide `structs` and `enums` which get serialized to `json` and passed to the `plotly.js` library to actually do the heavy lifting. As such, if you are familiar with `plotly.js` or its derivatives (e.g. the equivalent Python library), then you should find [`plotly.rs`](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs) intuitive to use.

A `Plot` struct contains one or more `Trace` objects which describe the structure of data to be displayed. Optional `Layout` and `Configuration` structs can be used to specify the layout and config of the plot, respectively.

The builder pattern is used extensively throughout the library, which means you only need to specify the attributes and details you desire. Any attributes that are not set will fall back to the default value used by `plotly.js`.

All available traces (e.g. `Scatter`, `Bar`, `Histogram`, etc), the `Layout`, `Configuration` and  `Plot` have been hoisted in the `plotly` namespace so that they can be imported simply using the following:

```rust
use plotly::{Plot, Layout, Scatter};
```

The aforementioned components can be combined to produce as simple plot as follows:

```rust
use plotly::common::Mode;
use plotly::{Plot, Scatter};

fn line_and_scatter_plot() {
    let trace1 = Scatter::new(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], vec![10, 15, 13, 17])
        .name("trace1")
        .mode(Mode::Markers);
    let trace2 = Scatter::new(vec![2, 3, 4, 5], vec![16, 5, 11, 9])
        .name("trace2")
        .mode(Mode::Lines);
    let trace3 = Scatter::new(vec![1, 2, 3, 4], vec![12, 9, 15, 12]).name("trace3");

    let mut plot = Plot::new();
    plot.add_trace(trace1);
    plot.add_trace(trace2);
    plot.add_trace(trace3);
    plot.show();
}

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    line_and_scatter_plot();
    Ok(())
}
```

which results in the following figure (displayed here as a static png file):

![line_and_scatter_plot](img/line_and_scatter_plot.png)

The above code will generate an interactive `html` page of the `Plot` and display it in the default browser. The `html` for the plot is stored in the platform specific temporary directory. To save the `html` result, you can do so quite simply:

```rust
plot.write_html("/home/user/line_and_scatter_plot.html");
```

It is often the case that plots are produced to be included in a document and a different format for the plot is desirable (e.g. png, jpeg, etc). Given that the `html` version of the plot is composed of vector graphics, the display when converted to a non-vector format (e.g. png) is not guaranteed to be identical to the one displayed in `html`. This means that some fine tuning may be required to get to the desired output. To support that iterative workflow, `Plot` has a `show_image()` method which will display the rasterised output to the target format, for example:

```rust
plot.show_image(ImageFormat::PNG, 1280, 900);
```

will display in the browser the rasterised plot; 1280 pixels wide and 900 pixels tall, in png format.

Once a satisfactory result is achieved, and assuming the [`kaleido`](getting_started#saving-plots) feature is enabled, the plot can be saved using the following:

```rust
plot.write_image("/home/user/plot_name.ext", ImageFormat::PNG, 1280, 900, 1.0);
```

The extension in the file-name path is optional as the appropriate extension (`ImageFormat::PNG`) will be included. Note that in all functions that save files to disk, both relative and absolute paths are supported.

## Saving Plots

To add the ability to save plots in the following formats: png, jpeg, webp, svg, pdf and eps, you can use the `kaleido` feature. This feature depends on [plotly/Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido): a cross-platform open source library for generating static images. All the necessary binaries have been included with `plotly_kaleido` for `Linux`, `Windows` and `MacOS`. Previous versions of [plotly.rs](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs) used the `orca` feature, however, this has been deprecated as it provided the same functionality but required additional installation steps. To enable the `kaleido` feature add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
plotly = { version = "0.8.4", features = ["kaleido"] }
```

## WebAssembly Support

As of v0.8.0, [plotly.rs](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.rs) can now be used in a `Wasm` environment by enabling the `wasm` feature in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
plotly = { version = ">=0.8.0" features = ["wasm"] }
```

The `wasm` feature exposes rudimentary bindings to the `plotly.js` library, which can then be used in a `wasm` environment such as the [`Yew`](https://yew.rs/) frontend framework.

To make a very simple `Plot` component might look something like:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

#[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]
pub struct PlotProps {
    pub id: String,
    pub plot: plotly::Plot,
    pub class: Option<Classes>,
}

#[function_component(Plot)]
pub fn plot(props: &PlotProps) -> Html {
    let PlotProps { id, plot, class } = props;

    let p = yew_hooks::use_async::<_, _, ()>({
        let id = id.clone();
        let plot = plot.clone();
        async move {
            plotly::bindings::new_plot(&id, &plot).await;
            Ok(())
        }
    });

    {
        let id = id.clone();
        let plot = plot.clone();
        use_effect_with_deps(
            move |(_, _)| {
                p.run();
                || ()
            },
            (id, plot),
        );
    }

    html! {
        <div id={id.clone()} class={class.clone()}></div>
    }
}
```
