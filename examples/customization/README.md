# HTML Customization

We often get issues/questions regarding customization of the HTML output. In most situations, these are not related to Plotly functionality but rather custom behavior related to HTML rendering.

The directory [./customization](./customization) contains examples of the most frequent raised questions by users of `plotly-rs`, such as
- making the resulting HTML plot responsive on browser window size change
- making the resulting HTML fill the entire browser page
- placing multiple plots in the same HTML page using the [`build_html`](https://crates.io/crates/build_html) crate
